###MULTIPLE REGRESSION
### [Household Food Waste: Multivariate Regression and Principal Components Analyses of Awareness and Attitudes among U.S. Consumers](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159250)


| **Statistical Analyses        |  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | alpha | link to paper **|
|:----------:|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
Multiple Regression   | 40 with 14 main ones | categorical for the most part | 1, did participant feel guilty about food waste| Logit/Binary | They did not really differentiate between variables
they were controlling for with what they thought were independent variables | N/A | What affects a person's likelihood of feeling guilty about food waste? | As a regression, there really isn't a 
hypothesis test. One could say that the null hypothesis is that the independent variables have a coefficient of zero on the dependent variable. | For the coefficients in the regression
there is a 0.05 alpha | See above for link |




### LOGISTIC REGRESSION
### [Predicting Falls and When to Intervene in Older People: A Multilevel Logistical Regression Model and Cost Analysis](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159365)


| **Statistical Analyses        |  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | alpha | link to paper **|
|:----------:|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
Logistic Regression   | 29 | categorical | 1, risk of falling| continuous | Again, there is not much between the control variables and the IV | N/A | What contributes
to the risk of an elderly person falling and given these variables what is that person's risk? | Like before, there isn't much in terms of a null hypothesis as this is a regression analysis.
One again could say that the null hypothesis is that the independent variable's coefficients are zero. | The alpha is 0.05 | See above |




## Assignment 3
I did this assignment by myself. I don't think I had much trouble with
this one but I wish I understood the pros and cons of using a
chi square test better.  


## Assignment 4 
I did the vast bulk of this assignment by myself. The only help I had 
from outside was that Sam Ovenshine told me about the Astral library
for Python. However, I did not end up using that. I had some difficulty
getting my code to see if a point was within a polygon. I am very used
to R so in some ways I love Pandas dataframes. But I really don't like
these series inside of them. It's a bit annoying. I need to get to know
GeoPandas a lot better.
