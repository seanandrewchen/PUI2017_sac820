  <b>Plot</b>: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Number of Cyclist-Motorist Incidents: Time of Day vs. Cause of Accident <br>

### Clarity:

<p>
Solid visualization of amount of different accidents depending on the time of the day. Regarding the clarity:
<ul>
<li>
Title allows to understand the plot and what it describes
</li>
<li>
Seems to miss a caption. Though Sean has a description above the plot in his repo, I would like to see more insights behind the results. 
</li>
<li>
Axes have measurements where needed, however, the font size could be a bit larger. At least the same as the title.
</li>
<li>
The additional gradient scale helps greatly in understanding the numbers of accidents, however, it seems to be a bit small, and could have been a bit larger.
</li>
<li>
Since tones of one color are used, color blindness check did not reveal anything misleading or misinterpretable.
</li>
</ul>
It would be great to have a bigger font size for the X-ticks and Y-ticks, for example 16-18. As a person who wears glasses, I couldn't read the ticks without them, though I could read the rest of the text.<br><br>
</p>

### Esthethic:
<p>
From the esthetic point of view:
<ul>
<li>
Nice visualisation, color gradient helps to understand the number of accident. Would have been nice to have horizontal borders separating the categories, to help easily detect the needed cell. The green color is contrasting great with the white background.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

### Honesty:

<p>
The visualisation represents the data quite good. The only concern that I have is that if I want to have the exact value of a cell, I might spend some time on matching the color of the cell with the gradient scale. Of course, the scale is quite precise, however, if I need more specific details, time needs to be spent (imagine the plot being printed using a bad, monochrome printer). <br><br>

**Overall**, great visualization of an important and very interesting analysis!
