a.
The null hypothesis (The ratio of riders from age 18 to 45 to all riders is the same as the ratio of riders from age 45 upwards to all riders.) was formulated incorrectly. It should read "The ratio of riders from age 18 to 45 to all riders is less than or the same as the ratio of riders from age 45 upwards to all riders."
The alternative hypothesis (The ratio of riders from age 18 to 45 to all riders is greater than the ratio of riders from age 45 upwards to all riders.) was formulated correctly.

b.
The data does indeed support the project idea. The data contains birth year information, which can be translated to age. The data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values.

c.
The appropriate test to test H0 in this case is the t test. The t test would serve this case well because of the normal/parametric distribution of the data in question and because of the presence of two unpaired groups.
