### Assignment 1
I did almost all the work myself. I only asked Sam Ovenshine a few times for clarification on some problems.
Full disclosure: I overheard people saying you needed to seed the pseudorandom number generator. So, I did that.
I've taken econometrics and stats a bazillion times but never have I actually had an exercise that so intuitively
helps you understand the Central Limit Theorem and Law of Large Numbers. If I had done this exercise in my first
stats class, I would have had a much easier time. I didn't get to spend enough time on this assignment. In the future I want to 
play around with plotting and learning more about the different distributions.


### Assignment 2
I had problems with my PUIdata folder, so I had to make a folder again in my home directory. Again, worked almost entirely
by myself. 


### Assignment 3
I'm a bit confused on what these numbers are for but it was easy enough to download them, find the mean, and test it.
